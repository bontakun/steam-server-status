Steam Server Status library
=========================

How to get it
-------------

The easiest way to get it is via [npm]

    npm install steam-server-status

If you want to run the latest version (i.e. later than the version available
via [npm]) you can clone this repo, then use [npm] to link-install it:

    npm link /path/to/your/clone

Of course, you can just clone this, and manually point at the library itself,
but I really recommend using [npm]!

How to use it
-------------

The library provides basic functionality for requesting the status and statistics of a steam source engine game. The simplest use case you just make a call like this:

    const steamServerStatus = require('steam-server-status');
    steamServerStatus.getServerStatus(
        'tf.bonta-kun.net', 27015, function(serverInfo) {
            if (serverInfo.error) {
                console.log(serverInfo.error);
            } else {
                console.log("game: " + serverInfo.gameName);
                console.log("server name: " + serverInfo.serverName);
                console.log("players: " + serverInfo.numberOfPlayers + "/" + serverInfo.maxNumberOfPlayers)
            }
    });

This will connect to a server and split out ot the logs what game the server is playing, what the server name is listed as and how many people are playing on it.
